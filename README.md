# Predict Titanic Survival 
 # Logistic Regression
 
In this project I was creating a Logistic Regression model that predicts which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic, based on features like age and class. The data I was using for training the model is provided by Kaggle.

1.	I loaded the passenger data, manipulated it with Pandas and Numpy in order to prepare data in columns for further analysis. 
2.	After I chose the features I was interested in and merged them, I split the data into the training and test sets. 
3.	Since sklearn‘s Logistic Regression implementation uses Regularization, I normalised the feature data with StandardScaler.
4.	Created the trained the model with LogisticRegression.
5.	Measured the model’s score and analysed the features coefficients determined by the model.  
6.	Used the trained model to make predictions on the survival of a few fateful passengers and the find the probabilities that led to these predictions.
